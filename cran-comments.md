This is a new submission.


The documentation and the functions are in German, because the package is intended for the DACH region. Only the package title and description are in English to be understandable for the average CRAN user.

The construction of forest yield tables in German-speaking countries is historically different from similar tools in other countries. Some parameters in these tables are not used internationally and are therefore difficult to translate. We believe that new yield tables will be adopted throughout Germany. They will be used primarily by forest planners, consultants, practitioners, and in caclulating taxes on forest land and harvests. These users are very familiar with the traditional abbreviations of the main parameters, which we have tried to preserve in pure ASCII.


This package checks okay locally on ubuntu 20.04 R-release, all win-builder flavors, macOS builder, Rhub's check_for_cran suite and Github Actions CI.


Thanks for your great service
  Robert
